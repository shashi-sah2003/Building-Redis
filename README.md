    - Demonstrates protocol parsing to handle multiple requests from a client.

3. [Event Loop and Nonblocking IO](3-Event-loop-and-Nonblocking-IO/README.md)
    - Explains how to handle multiple client connections using event loops and nonblocking IO.

4. [HashTable Data Serialization](4-HashTable_Data-Serialization/README.md)
    - Shows how to store key-value pairs in a hash map with data serialization.

5. [Sorted Set in Redis](5-SortedSet-AVL/README.md)
    - Implements a sorted set data structure using AVL trees, useful for maintaining a sorted list of items.
