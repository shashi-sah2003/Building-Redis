Storing key-value pairs in a hash map (data structure)

1. Double Hashtable for Resizing (uses 2 hashtables ht1 & ht2)
when load factor exceeds the maximum, resizing begins and nodes are
moved from ht2 to ht1.

The server listens for commands like get, set, del, and keys, each 
corresponding to operations on the underlying key-value store.

We have also generalized the encoding to handle different types of data.
(Data Serialization) so that we can also get list of strings as response.
